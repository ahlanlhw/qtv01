trade strategy

i) check portfolio balance
ii) wait 300 records then_
    calculate sequential and standardize
    calculate jerk by difference of seq
ii) on increasing sequential cml_vol -buy
iii) decreasing sequential, sell
iv) on jerk, sell

execution method
i) buy using limit done
ii) exit using OCO sell order done

programming to-do list
i) calculate sequential and jerk
ii) save into csv file 
iii) trade order generator script to 
	-> read from all pair csv, 
	-> compile all pairs and trade ideas
		- buy up to 60% of usdt value
	-> size the trades and notionals
		- each order 50$?3 pairs at max
		- set limit buy order
		- get all open orders statuses
     another script to run orders
	->based off latest bid ask
	-> query position size, cannot be more than 30%*60% of USDT
	observe market then use async
		to execute trades
	-> for each pair run 

10/10/2020
-> !Miniticker will scan for top volume1 socket
-> Aggtrade stream for 30 pairs defined by
	-sequential and jerk saved into each
		pair's CSV 1 socket
-> Consolidates into a 
-> 

sample test run on 1 pair first
-> 1 script with methods to run for each aggTrade pair
	-> with this script of methods, will input into main to run multiple streams and save into csv
-> one script to read each csv and assess sequential (average of sequential) to enter at bid
-> order execution -> marketDOM (for order execution), buy plus OCO order for exit
